It contains six columns to store the variables: 
index, days gone since purchase, brand of product, buyer's age, buyer's sex and product's grade (review). 
Data are either integers, float numbers or strings (chars).
The delimiters used to seperate variables are commas.

Aquired data focuses on reviews of vacuum cleaners sold at specific store based in one of sixteen
